antiBallsheet is an engaging reaction game built as an improvement over an old project, [ballsheet](https://github.com/dphdmn/ballsheet).

### Major Differences:
- **Simple Speedrun Approach**: Collect a set number of balls as quickly as possible without complex pressure formulas.
- **Customization Settings**: Tailor the game to your preferences with various customization options.
- **Improved Performance**: Enjoy smoother gameplay as the game no longer relies on p5.js (or canvas at all).
- **Clean Interface**: Experience a user-friendly interface free from complicated stats, unnecessary controls, and flashing numbers during gameplay.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Utilize much better graph powered by the graph.js library.
- **Custom styles**: You can change colors as much as you like! (Custom cursor colors not yet implemented, but you can disable it, by setting size to 0, then it would use your default windows cursor)
